# Write an SQL query to report for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.
# SQL code：
select a1.player_id, 
       a1.event_date, 
       sum(a2.games_played) as games_played_so_far
from Activity a1
inner join Activity a2 
      on a1.player_id = a2.player_id
      and a1.event_date >= a2.event_date
group by a1.player_id, a1.event_date;



# Write an SQL query to calculate the cumulative salary summary for every employee in a single unified table.
# The cumulative salary summary for an employee can be calculated as follows:
# For each month that the employee worked, sum up the salaries in that month and the previous two months. This is their 3-month sum for that month. If an employee did not work for the company in previous months, their effective salary for those months is 0.
# Do not include the 3-month sum for the most recent month that the employee worked for in the summary.
# Do not include the 3-month sum for any month the employee did not work.
# SQL code：
select e1.Id,
       e1.Month,
       sum(e2.Salary) as Salary
from Employee e1
inner join Employee e2
      on e1.Id=e2.Id
      and e1.Month >= e2.Month
      and e1.Month < e2.Month+3
where (e1.Id,e1.Month) not in (
          select Id,max(Month) as Month
          from Employee
          group by Id
      )
group by e1.Id,e1.Month
order by e1.Id,e1.Month desc;
