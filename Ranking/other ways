# No.1 of the ranking
# group by->order by desc->limit 1
# 1.Write an SQL query to report the name of the winning candidate (i.e., the candidate who got the largest number of votes).There are 3 ways to write the SQL:

# Way 1:
select c.name 
from Vote v
left join Candidate c on v.candidateId=c.id
group by c.name
having count(*)
order by count(*) desc
limit 1;

# Way 2:
select name
from Candidate c
inner join (
             select candidateId
             from  Vote
             group by candidateId
             having count(id)
             order by count(id) desc 
             limit 1) as Winner
             on c.id=Winner.candidateId;
             
# Way 3:
select name
from (
  select CandidateId as id
  from Vote
  group by CandidateId
  order by count(id) desc
  limit 1
) as Winner join Candidate
on Winner.id = Candidate.id
